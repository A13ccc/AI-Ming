## Gamepad Functionality

- **Gamepad Sending**: The feature for sending data via Gamepad is currently not completly done and still under active development.
    This feature is only implemented in the Additional Trigger (TriggerAdditionalSend)
    Later on, this feature will be implemented for Aiming and Main trigger as well.
- **Controller Mapping**: Despite the issues with Gamepad sending, the controller mapping feature is fully functional and works as intended.
